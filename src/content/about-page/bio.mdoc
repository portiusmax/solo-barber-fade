I'm Marcus — a Chicago-born barber with a passion for precision and a deep respect for the craft.

I picked up my first pair of clippers at 16, cutting hair for friends and family in my mom's kitchen. What started as a way to make pocket money became my calling. I trained at the Chicago School of Barbering, earned my master barber license, and spent years learning from some of the best barbers in the city.

**My philosophy is simple:** every cut is a collaboration. I listen to what you want, assess your hair type and face shape, and deliver a cut that makes you feel confident. No rushing, no shortcuts — just honest, skilled work.

I've built my clientele one chair at a time, and I treat every person who sits down like they're my most important client. Because they are.
